# Discord-Tenor-Exploit
A sparkJava application that renders an image from a Tenor URL (Used for the Discord Tenor Exploit) [tpnor.com]

## Technologies used
- sparkJava
- Google Gson

## How does the exploit work?
Discord's client utilises a search and replace system for their message editing system, this works by typing the message ``s/<find>/<replace>`` - in this example when you send a tenor URL ``https://tenor.com/view/my-dog-stood-on-a-bee-amber-heard-johnny-depp-dog-bee-gif-25657536`` when typed ``s/e/p`` as a new message, it will replace ``tenor.com`` to ``tpnor.com`` which is our own hosted website, and grabs the Tenor Gif from the number id.
